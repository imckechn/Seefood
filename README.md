# No Hot Dog

This is my own version of the SeeFood app from the Silicon Valley TV show by HBO. It identifies if the image contains a hotdog or not. It uses pytorch and torchvision to to perform transfer learning on a pretrained resnet model and then uses the model to predict if the image contains a hotdog or not.

The source of the idea is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIci3C4JkL0
