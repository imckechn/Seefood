# SeeFood (Not Hot Dog)

This is my own version of the SeeFood app from the Silicon Valley TV show by HBO. It identifies if the image contains a hotdog or not. It uses pytorch and torchvision to to perform transfer learning on a pretrained resnet model and then uses the model to predict if the image contains a hotdog or not.

## Usage
It's written using Jupyter Notebooks so feel free to checkout Seefood.ipynb and run it yourself. It will also show you some demonstrations of the model in action.
